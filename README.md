## Before you buy

#### Can I list the latest episodes on my homepage?
We rely on default Stamatic Collection Tags to manage your episodes. Is easy has calling the folling antlers tag:
```
{{ collection:episodes }}
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>Episode {{ episode_number }}</p>
    <p><a href="{{ permalink }}">View episode</a></p>
{{ /collection:episodes }}
```

#### Can I get the list of every Tag to use?
We use a default Stamatic Blueprint to manage every field and value. Simply open the `Episode Blueprint` and select the field you cant. You can even customize its handle if you prefer.

#### Can I have an embeddable audio player ?
You can use any web audio player such as [Green Audio Player](https://github.com/greghub/green-audio-player).  
First, include their CDN in a script tag.
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/greghub/green-audio-player/dist/js/green-audio-player.min.js
```
Then, add this code in your `<head>` `<script>` section of your layout:
```
GreenAudioPlayer.init({
    selector: '.player',
    stopOthersOnPlay: true
});
```

And where you want to include the player:
```
<div class="player">
    <audio>
        <source src="{{ episode_file | get:permalink }}" type="{{ episode_file | mime_content_type }}">
    </audio>
</div>
```
